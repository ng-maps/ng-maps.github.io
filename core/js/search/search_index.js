@ng-maps/core\n\nThen you will need to install typings for google maps as a dev dependency\n\nNpm: npm install -D @types/googlemaps\nYarn: yarn add -D @types/googlemaps\n\nNow you are ready to start. Add NgMapsCoreModule.forRoot({apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY'}) to your AppModule. Now you can use map components.\nLazy loading configuration\nIf you can not provide configuration at module import level you can load it at a later time.\nYou just need to inject MapsAPILoader into a component or service and call the method configure(config) with a valid configuration.\nUsage\nSimple Map\nAdd the map to your components template\nAdd a height to your components CSS, for example\nmap-view {\n  height: 300px;\n}Input options\n\n\n\nName\nType\nValues\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nlongitude\nNumber\n\n\n\n\nlatitude\nNumber\n\n\n\n\nminZoom\nNumber\n\n\n\n\nmaxZoom\nNumber\n\n\n\n\nzoom\nNumber\nBetween 0 and MaxZoom, typically 18\n\n\n\nfitBounds\nLatLngBoundsLiteral, LatLngBounds or Boolean\nIf set to true attaches to mapFitBounds directives on \n\n\n\nmapTypeId\nroadmap, hybrid, satellite, terrain\n\n\n\n\nlayers\nArray or String\nTrafficLayer or TransitLayer or BicyclingLayer\nActivates layer as described in TrafficLayer Documentation\n\n\n\nMarker\nAdditionally you can add markers\n\n  \nInput options\n\n\n\nName\nType\nValues\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nlongitude\nNumber\n\n\n\n\nlatitude\nNumber\n\n\n\n\n\nOutputs\n\n\n\nName\nValue\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nmarkerClick\nComponent\n\n\n\n\nAdditional features\nOther features are provided in submodules.
