The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.\nPublishing\nAfter building your library with ng build drawing-layer, go to the dist folder cd dist/drawing-layer and run npm publish.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test drawing-layer to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules - modules","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n    Modules\n\n\n    \n            \n                \n                    \n                        NgMapsDrawingLayerModule\n                    \n                    \n                                \n                                    \n                                        Your browser does not support SVG\n                                    \n                                \n                        \n                            Browse\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"overview.html":{"url":"overview.html","title":"overview - overview","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n    Overview\n\n  \n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n\ndependencies\n\ndependencies\n\ncluster_NgMapsDrawingLayerModule\n\n\n\ncluster_NgMapsDrawingLayerModule_declarations\n\n\n\ncluster_NgMapsDrawingLayerModule_exports\n\n\n\n\nNgMapsDrawingLayer\n\nNgMapsDrawingLayer\n\n\n\nNgMapsDrawingLayerModule\n\nNgMapsDrawingLayerModule\n\nNgMapsDrawingLayerModule -->\n\nNgMapsDrawingLayer->NgMapsDrawingLayerModule\n\n\n\n\n\nNgMapsDrawingLayer \n\nNgMapsDrawingLayer \n\nNgMapsDrawingLayer  -->\n\nNgMapsDrawingLayerModule->NgMapsDrawingLayer \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        Zoom in\n        Reset\n        Zoom out\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        1 Module\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    1 Directive\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    1 Injectable\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"properties.html":{"url":"properties.html","title":"package-properties - properties","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Properties\n    \n    \n        \n            Version : 1.0.0\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"miscellaneous/variables.html":{"url":"miscellaneous/variables.html","title":"miscellaneous-variables - variables","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Miscellaneous\n  Variables\n\n\n\n    Index\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            drawingManagerId   (src/.../drawing-layer.ts)\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    src/lib/directives/drawing-layer.ts\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        drawingManagerId\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Type :         number\n\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Default value : 0\n                    \n                \n\n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
