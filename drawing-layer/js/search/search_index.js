The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.\nPublishing\nAfter building your library with ng build drawing-layer, go to the dist folder cd dist/drawing-layer and run npm publish.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test drawing-layer to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules - modules","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n    Modules\n\n\n    \n            \n                \n                    \n                        NgMapsDrawingLayerModule\n                    \n                    \n                                \n                                    \n                                        Your browser does not support SVG\n                                    \n                                \n                        \n                            Browse\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"overview.html":{"url":"overview.html","title":"overview - overview","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n    Overview\n\n  \n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n\ndependencies\n\nLegend\n\n  Declarations\n\n  Module\n\n  Bootstrap\n\n  Providers\n\n  Exports\n\ncluster_NgMapsDrawingLayerModule\n\n\n\ncluster_NgMapsDrawingLayerModule_declarations\n\n\n\ncluster_NgMapsDrawingLayerModule_exports\n\n\n\n\nNgMapsDrawingLayer\n\nNgMapsDrawingLayer\n\n\n\nNgMapsDrawingLayerModule\n\nNgMapsDrawingLayerModule\n\nNgMapsDrawingLayerModule -->\n\nNgMapsDrawingLayer->NgMapsDrawingLayerModule\n\n\n\n\n\nNgMapsDrawingLayer \n\nNgMapsDrawingLayer \n\nNgMapsDrawingLayer  -->\n\nNgMapsDrawingLayerModule->NgMapsDrawingLayer \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        Zoom in\n        Reset\n        Zoom out\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        1 Module\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    1 Directive\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    1 Injectable\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"miscellaneous/variables.html":{"url":"miscellaneous/variables.html","title":"miscellaneous-variables - variables","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n  Miscellaneous\n  Variables\n\n\n\n    Index\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            drawingManagerId   (src/.../drawing-layer.ts)\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    src/lib/directives/drawing-layer.ts\n    \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                            drawingManagerId\n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Type :         number\n\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            Default value : 0\n                        \n                    \n\n\n            \n        \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
