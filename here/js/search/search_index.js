The input parameters for the function are (1) the array of markers\nrepresented by a cluster marker and (2) the number of cluster icon styles. It returns a\nClusterIconInfo object.

The styles array element used has an index of\nindex minus 1. For example, the default calculator returns a\ntext value of \"125\" and an index of 3\nfor a cluster icon representing 125 markers so the element used in the styles\narray is 2. A calculator may also return a title\nproperty that contains the text of the tooltip to be used for the cluster marker.
